## Exploratory Data Analysis of Uber Ride Requests

### Project Overview
This project performs an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Uber ride request data to identify demand–supply gaps and understand the reasons behind trip failures such as cancellations and unavailability of cars.

The analysis focuses on time-based and location-based patterns to help improve operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.

---

### Business Objective
To analyze Uber ride request data and identify key factors causing unmet demand, enabling data-driven recommendations to improve trip completion rates and service reliability.

---

### Dataset Description
- Dataset: Uber Request Data
- Records: 6,745
- Features: Request details, pickup point, request hour, day, and trip status

---

### Tools & Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas[Sample_EDA_Submission_Template Aryan.ipynb](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/24644757/Sample_EDA_Submission_Template.Aryan.ipynb)

- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

### Key Analysis Performed
- Univariate Analysis
- Bivariate Analysis
- Multivariate Analysis
- Demand–Supply Gap Identification
- Time-based and Location-based Trend Analysis

---

### Key Insights
- High number of failed trips due to car unavailability during early morning airport requests
- High cancellation rates in city areas during peak evening hours
- Demand is high, but supply is not efficiently managed across time and locations

---

### Business Recommendations
- Increase driver incentives during peak demand hours
- Reduce cancellations through penalties and traffic-based incentives
- Implement location-based driver allocation and demand forecasting

---

### Conclusion
The analysis shows that Uber’s primary challenge is supply-side inefficiency rather than lack of demand. By adopting time- and location-specific operational strategies, Uber can significantly improve trip fulfillment, customer satisfaction, and revenue.
